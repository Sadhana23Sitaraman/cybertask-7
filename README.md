**Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions**

**Objective:**
To review all browser extensions installed in Google Chrome, identify any that are unsafe or unnecessary, and remove them to improve browser security and performance.

---

**Steps Taken:**

1. Opened the extensions manager by typing `chrome://extensions` in the Chrome address bar.

2. Chrome immediately flagged one extension — *Free VPN ZenMate – Best VPN for Chrome* — under the Safety Check section. The message stated that Chrome couldn't verify where the extension came from.

3. Based on the warning and the fact that I didn’t recall installing it, I removed the VPN extension.

4. I reviewed all remaining extensions individually. I checked:

   * If I had intentionally installed them
   * Their descriptions and functionality
   * The permissions they required

5. I removed any that were not in use or seemed unnecessary. The trusted and useful ones were kept.

6. Restarted the browser after removing the suspicious extension.

7. After restarting, I noticed improved responsiveness and no more safety warnings in the extensions section.

**Learnings from the Task:**

* Even known-looking extensions can be flagged as suspicious if not verified.
* Chrome’s Safety Check is a useful tool to catch potentially harmful extensions early.
* It’s important to regularly audit extensions to avoid privacy or security issues.
* Extensions asking for broad permissions like reading data on all sites should be carefully reviewed.
* Removing unused extensions not only reduces risk but can also improve browser performance.

---

**Mitigation Steps:**

* Removed the unverified VPN extension immediately.
* Retained only extensions that are trusted and actively used.
* Activated Chrome’s built-in Safety Check to receive future alerts.
* Will make it a habit to periodically review installed extensions.
* Will avoid installing extensions from unknown sources or developers.
* Will check extension permissions closely before installing anything new.
